I was first introduced to Bon Iver while looking for a present for my brother, a friend recommended the album "For Emma, Forever Ago".  I guess I didn't actually listen any of his music till I overheard my brother listening to the album. It has been one of my favorite artists since then. With so many brilliant tracks to choose from, my favorite track is the title track from the cold and wintry Blood Bank EP. 

Last year, I was lucky enough to see Bon Iver at the Hammersmith Apollo, it what is easily one of my favorite concert. Something about the gig was very special. The combination of surprisingly good sound quality, the "Bon Iver, Bon Iver" albums big band sound, and the set was superb.The highlight of the evening was "updated" rendition of Blood Bank, encompassing the whole band and producing a faster, almost post-rock sound, completely different from the EP version which is a slow, emotion filled song. What the version lost in emotion, it made up for in power; the huge band complete with two drum kits sounded amazing, there's just something about 4 toms being bashed at once that I love. Would I say I preferred this version? I'm not sure, but it was certainly a highlight for me. 

As with many of Bon Iver's track, the lyrics are solid. They are both poetic and easy to relate to.

    That secret that you knew
    But don't know how to tell
    It fucks with your honor
    And it teases your head
    But you know that its good girl
    Cos its running you with red

Vernon's vocals are equally fitting, emotion filled and haunting in the break downs. 

Bon Iver has received a lot of criticism for his latest album. While I wouldn't say I preferred it to his first album, I certainly enjoy his new sound just as much. Instrumentally, the album is great, such a diverse instrument choice and all are very complementary to his vocals. The stand out track for me is Holocene, based off his earlier, unreleased song Hazeltons. Beth/Rest seems to be disliked by many, but I actually really like the track, maybe because I love the Gabriel/Collins sound he is going for.

I'm very interested to see how his sound develops from here. Its clear from his involvement in Ganygs and Kanye's latest album that he loves experimenting with his sound, I just hope he doesn't stray too far from his more acoustic roots. I do love his experimentation, I loved his vocals on "My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy" but I also like his older work with Volcano Choir where he stayed a lot closer to FEFA in terms of sound.
