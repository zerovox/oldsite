>In this episode of PNL, Sinek talks to us about his book Start With Why. By studying the leaders and companies that make the greatest impact and have produced some of the most disruptive technologies in the world, he discovered the formula that explains how they did it. By using the biology of human decision making, Sinek created the simple idea of the golden circle, which breaks down to what, how, and why.

>Companies that have had the smallest impact have focused on what and how without really thinking about why, such as tooth paste companies making 30+ different kinds of toothpaste yet we donâ€™t know why we need so many flavors. Whereas, the companies and leaders with the greatest impact are those who have started with why and then figured out what and how afterwards. He points to such companies as Google and leaders such as Martin Luther King Jr. to elucidate how they were so effective.

A brilliant talk by Simon Sinek on leadership. The first question, around the 35min mark, asks about what happens when a company loses its vision, the old timers start saying "It's not like it used to be" and foucses on competition not their vision, they start to fail and theres a 'split' in the company. This seems to describe perfectly what is happening at Google at the moment. They've lost their vision, they aren't focusing on not being evil, and exploring new ideas with the 20% time, they've started monetrising everything, spending time looking at the competition rather than inovating. And as Simon says, "there can't be inovation without why".

He goes on to talk about the How Types and the Why Types, and how the CEO has to be a visionary and a leader who knows where they are going but not how to get there, not an operational focused person who knows how to do things but not why they are doing them, and how this appliest to politics.
